# Facial_Recognition_1.0
## Introduction:
Hello! Welcome to my first personal project that I will posting on GitHub! 

## Description:
A personal project that uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Eigenfaces to identify whether or not a face belongs to Duke Parks (me).

## Credit and Thanks:
While I developed this program independently, I would like to first thank the 'Yale Face Database' and 'Yale Face Database B'.  The images in these databases are what enabled to me create the Eigenfaces that my program relies on.  Additionally, I learned PCA in part from 'Data-Driven Science and Engineering: Machine Learning, Dynamical Systems, and Control' by Dr. Brunton and Dr. Kutz.  This book also very conviently provided me with a matrix of data computed from the 'Yale Face Database B' which I used in my program.  This matrix can be found in 'allFaces.mat' in the Data folder.
